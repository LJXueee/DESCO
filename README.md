**The format of the model is divided into mdl and slx according to the Simulink standard. If you use some third-party open source models, make sure that the dependencies 
between the models and the data are loaded into your memory. We do not recommend using third-party models in unfiltered conditions, which will cause your computer
to crash abnormally. Please be careful**

### Our Works
Simulink is MathWorks' Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) development tool, widely used across various domains including automotive, aerospace, and healthcare. It enables non-software engineers to rapidly build models by adding modular block diagrams. When a Simulink model meets requirements, engineers can use automatic code generation tools, such as Embedded Coder, to convert it into embedded code (e.g., C source code), deployable in safety-critical applications. However, due to errors or incorrect implementations in code generation, unexpected behaviors in the target application may arise, posing safety risks. In this paper, we introduce DESCO, the first differential testing method based on the partitioning of CPS modules according to the model's wiring structure. DESCO considers the closeness of connections between CPS modules for partitioning, aiming to generate Simulink models that better conform to partitioning requirements and are more diverse and complex. It thoroughly validates the code generation process, uncovering errors in the code generation. The experiments demonstrate that DESCO outperforms existing methods significantly. Currently, 16 code generation bugs have been identified, with 12 of them confirmed.

### If you want to use our model quickly, some steps need to be done.
Before you start, put the seed files you need for your experiment in the folder 'corpus_seed'.

Second, if you want to run this method more carefully, you should configure the 'cfg.m' file, in which you can modify the files and intermediate file paths you use to save the generated code, as well as the number of variant models to be generated.

Once configured, add the `courpus_seed` folder to the working path, which is set to ```addpath(Seed_Model_Path)```

When all of the above preparation is complete, you simply enter ```ModelProcessing``` on the Matlab command line to launch the program and begin the model partitioning and variant process.This will help you get started with LPAPART tools.



note: When the program is interrupted due to some accident, you can continue the experiment by modifying the loop order 'i' in the file ```ModelProcessing.m``` according to the progress that has been completed before.

### Here are the details of these bugs.
These errors in the error file can be reproduced using Matlab R2023a.

You can find all bug files in path `CodeG-Bug`.

The 'CodeG-Bug' folder contains the compressed package of all bug-related information, including the model that triggers the bug, the model equivalent model, the comparison diagram of the execution results obtained by using the data inspector, and the detailed introduction of the bugs.
